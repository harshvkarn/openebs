## How Can I Help?

Documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement!

There's a curated list of issues, [Good First Issue](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that should not need deep knowledge of the system.

To dig deeper, please start by having a look at [OpenEBS Architecture](../contribute/design/README.md).

There's always code that can be clarified and variables or functions that can be renamed or commented and need for more test coverage.
